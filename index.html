      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Around the world, communities struggle with preventable health problems. Millions lack access to affordable healthcare, malnutrition is widespread, and mental health care remains stigmatized.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Philippines, many rural areas lack proper clinics, child malnutrition rates are high, and access to medical care is limited.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Being Done?</h2>
      <p>
        Governments and NGOs are addressing these challenges through health reforms, nutrition programs, and awareness campaigns. In the Philippines, the "First 1,000 Days" campaign improves child nutrition, and Universal Health Care expands coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Internationally, WHO and UNICEF provide vaccines, nutrition support, and education programs. Tech-based healthcare solutions reach remote communities.
